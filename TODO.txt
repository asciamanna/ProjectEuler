ProjectEuler Project:
_____________________
1) Fill in missing descriptions on EulerProblem attributes
2) Fix issue with data file references as relative directories (fails when running problems from
Problem Runner exe
3) Remove SolveToConsole method once ProblemRunner works (will be redundant)
4) change base Problem class to interface once Problem runner works (will be redundant)
5) Convert ProjectEuler project to be a dll instead of exe one Problem Runner works).

ProblemRunner Project:
______________________
1) Use attributes in reflection instead of class names.
